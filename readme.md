# Are.na Note-taking

Construct a frontend for channels and edit blocks.

- should have a block history of edits (in local storage?)
- way to store and export templates
- components have access to AUTH, DRAFTS, HISTORY

Auth: is your auth
Hisotry: is edit history of blocks
Drafts: is in progress edits

# TODO

- right now view returns a string of html, make this an element reference so can attach attributes and stuff to it.
